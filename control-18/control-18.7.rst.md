# 18.7: Apply Static and Dynamic Code Analysis Tools

Apply static and dynamic analysis tools to verify that secure coding
practices are being adhered to for internally developed software.

  Asset Type   Security Function   Implementation Groups
  ------------ ------------------- -----------------------
  N/A          N/A                 2, 3

## Dependencies

-   Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software

## Inputs

1.  The inventory of internally-developed software (from the
    organization\'s software inventory)
2.  The inventory of static analysis tools (from the organization\'s
    software inventory)
3.  The inventory of dynamic analysis tools (from the organization\'s
    software inventory)

## Operations

1.  Map the inventory of internally-developed software to the applicable
    static/dynamic analysis tools which are used for verification.

## Measures

-   M1(i) = (For each software \"i\" from Input 1) 1 if the software is
    verified by static analysis tool(s); 0 otherwise
-   M2(i) = (For each software \"i\" from Input 1) 1 if the software is
    verified by dynamic analysis tool(s); 0 otherwise
-   M3 = Count of internally developed software (the count of Input 1)

## Metrics

### Static Analysis Tool Coverage

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Metric**      | | The ratio of internally developed software      |
|                 |   verified by static analysis tools to the        |
|                 | | total number of internally developed software   |
|                 |   applications                                    |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Calculation** | `(SUM from i=1..M3 (M1(i))) / M3`                 |
