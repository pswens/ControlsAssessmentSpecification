# 18.9: Separate Production and Non-Production Systems

Maintain separate environments for production and non-production
systems. Developers should not have unmonitored access to production
environments.

  ------------ ------------------- -----------------------
  N/A          N/A                 2, 3

## Dependencies

-   Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
-   Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
-   Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
-   Sub-control 2.5: Integrate Software and Hardware Asset Inventories

## Inputs

1.  The inventory of systems used for production and non-production
    deployments
2.  The inventory of user accounts
3.  The mechanism for monitoring user account access to systems

## Operations

1.  From Input 1, categorize the deployments of systems into those with
    production deployments and those with non-production deployments.
    Note that systems *should* have both production and 1..n
    non-production deployments (including development, staging,
    integration testing, etc).
2.  From Input 2, determine the list of user accounts with access to
    production environments

## Measures

-   M1(i) = (For each system with a production deployment \"i\") 1 if at
    least one non-production deployment environment exists for that
    system, 0 otherwise.
-   M2 = Count of systems with a production deployment
-   M3 = Count of user accounts whose access to production environments
    is monitored by the mechanism defined by Input 3.
-   M4 = Count of user accounts with access to production environments
    (the count from Operation 2).

## Metrics

### Environment Coverage

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Metric**      | | The ratio of production systems where at least  |
|                 |   one non-production deployment exists            |
|                 | | to the total number of production systems       |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Calculation** | `(SUM from i=1..M2 (M1(i))) / M2`                 |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+

### Monitored Account Coverage

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Metric**      | | The ratio of accounts with production system    |
|                 |   access that are monitored to the total          |
|                 | | accounts with production system access          |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Calculation** | `M3 / M4`                                         |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
