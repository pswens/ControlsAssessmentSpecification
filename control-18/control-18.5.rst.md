## Inputs

1.  `GV55`: Most Recent Internal Penetration Report

## Operations

1.  Check Input 1 `GV55` for date of most recent internal penetration
    test. Compare date to current date and capture timeframe in months
    (M1)

## Measures

## Metrics

-   If M1 is greater than twelve months, then this safeguard is measured
    at a 0 and receives a failing score. The other metrics don\'t apply.
