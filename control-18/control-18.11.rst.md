# 18.11: Use Standard Hardening Configuration Templates for Databases

For applications that rely on a database, use standard hardening
configuration templates. All systems that are part of critical business
processes should also be tested.

## Dependencies

-   Sub-control 1.4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory
-   Sub-control 1.5: Maintain Asset Inventory Information
-   Sub-control 2.1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software
-   Sub-control 2.5: Integrate Software and Hardware Asset Inventories
-   Sub-control 5.1: Establish Secure Configurations

## Inputs

1.  The list of database management software being used in the
    organization
2.  The list of systems on which database instances reside
3.  The list of enterprise security configuration standards

## Operations

1.  Determine, from the list of enterprise security configuration
    standards, which are applicable to database management software (M1)
2.  From the list of enterprise security configuration standards,
    calculate the number of database management software that are
    covered by the standards (perform the intersection of the results of
    Operation 1 with Input 1; the result is M2)

## Measures

-   M1 = List of enterprise security configuration standards specific to
    database management systems
-   M2 = Count of M1
-   M3 = List of database management software covered by applicable
    enterprise security configuration standards
-   M4 = Count of M3
-   M5 = List of database management software not covered by applicable
    enterprise security configuration standards
-   M6 = Count of M5
-   M7 = Count of database management software being used in the
    organization (from Input 1)

## Metrics

### Coverage

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Metric**      | | The ratio of database management software       |
|                 |   covered by applicable enterprise security       |
|                 | | configuration standards to the total number of  |
|                 |   database management software                    |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Calculation** | `M4 / M7`                                         |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+

**NOTE**: The second ask of this sub-control speaks to assessment of
Input 2 against security configuration standards determined by Operation
1.
