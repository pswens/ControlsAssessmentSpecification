# 18.2: Perform Periodic External Penetration Tests

Perform periodic external penetration tests based on program
requirements, no less than annually. External penetration testing must
include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect
exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills
and experience and must be conducted through a qualified party. The
testing may be clear box or opaque box.

## Dependencies

-   Safeguard 18.1: Establish and Maintain a Penetration Testing Program

## Inputs

1.  `GV54`: Most Recent External Penetration Report

## Operations

1.  Check Input 1 `GV54` for date of most recent external penetration
    test. Compare date to current date and capture timeframe in months
    (M1)

## Measures

-   M1 = Timeframe since last external penetration test

## Metrics

-   If M1 is greater than twelve months, then this safeguard is measured
    at a 0 and receives a failing score. The other metrics don\'t apply.
