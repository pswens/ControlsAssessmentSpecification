## Dependencies

-   Safeguard 2.1: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory

## Inputs

1.  `GV5`: Authorized software inventory
2.  Authoritative source of information indicating supported/unsupported
    details by product.

## Operations

1.  Use `GV5` to identify and enumerate web browser and email client
    software (M1)

2.  

    Compare each software identified in Operation 1 to Input 2

    :   1.  Identify and enumerate software labeled as \"supported\"
            that is currently supported (M2)
        2.  Identify and enumerate software labeled as \"supported\"
            that is currently unsupported (M3)
        3.  Identify and enumerate software labeled as \"unsupported\"
            that is currently unsupported (M4)
        4.  Identify and enumerate software labeled as \"unsupported\"
            that is currently supported (M5)

## Measures

-   M1 = Count of authorized web browser and email client software
-   M2 = Count of software labeled as \"supported\" and currently
    supported
-   M3 = Count of software labeled as \"supported\" and currently
    unsupported
-   M4 = Count of software labeled as \"unsupported\" and currently
    unsupported
-   M5 = Count of software labeled as \"unsupported\" and currently
    supported
