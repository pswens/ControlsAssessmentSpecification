# 2.3: Address Unauthorized Software

Ensure that unauthorized software is either removed from use on
enterprise assets or receives a documented exception. Review monthly, or
more frequently..

## Dependencies

-   Safeguard 1.1: Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset
    Inventory
-   Safeguard 2.1: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory

## Inputs

1.  `GV5`: Authorized software inventory
2.  `GV1`: Enterprise asset Invetory
3.  Enterprise defined timeframe for scanning of enterprise assets.
4.  Enterprise defined allowable timeframe for resolution of discovered
    unauthorized software (recommend at least monthly)

Assumptions \-\-\-\-\-\-\--#. The scanning schedule timeframe is greater
than the enterprise defined allowable timeframe for resolution of
discovered unauthorized software.

Operations \-\-\-\-\-\-\--#. Identify the software capable enterprise
assets in `GV1` (`GV7`) #. Scan the assets identified in Operation 1 and
note software present on each asset (M1) #. Compare the scan results to
the authorized software list in `GV5` #. Enumerate unauthorized software
identified on assets (M2) #. Conduct subsquent scan of assets identified
in Operation 1 as dictated by timeframe in Input 3 #. Compare to list
generated in Operation 3 (M2) #. For each software still present in
Operation 4, check the authorized software list in `GV5` #. Software
that remains installed and is not listed in `GV5` is placed on the
unaddressed software list (M3) for that asset.

## Measures

-   M1 = The count of software installed on a given asset
-   M2 = The count of unauthorized software installed on a given asset
-   M3 = The count of unaddressed software installed on a given asset,
    identified by follow-up scan.
-   M4 = Timeframe for resolution of discovered unauthorized software in
    weeks

## Metrics

-   If M4 is greater than four weeks, then this safeguard is measured at
    a 0 and receives a failing score. The other metrics don't apply.
