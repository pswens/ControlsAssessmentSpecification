# 8.4: Standardize Time Synchronization

Standardize time synchronization. Configure at least two synchronized
time sources across enterprise assets, where supported.

## Dependencies

-   Safeguard 1.1: Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset
    Inventory

## Inputs

1.  `GV27`: Assets capable of supporting logging
2.  List of approved network time sources/NTP servers

## Operations

1.  Using :code:\'GV27\`, identify and enumerate assets capable of
    supporting time synchronization (M1)

2.  

    Check the configurations of the assets identified in Operation 1

    :   1.  Identify and enumerate the assets configured using at least
            two approved time sources from Input 2 (M2)
        2.  Identify and enumerate the assets configured using time
            sources not on the approved list (M3)
        3.  Identify and enumerate the assets not configured using time
            sources (M4)

## Measures

-   M1 = Count of logging capable assets that support time
    synchronization
-   M2 = Count of properly configured assets using at least two approve
    time sources
-   M3 = Count of assets configured using non-approved time sources
-   M4 = Count of assets not configured to use time sources

## Metrics

NTP Compliance Coverage \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^ .. list-table:

    * - **Metric**
      - | The percentage of assets propery configured to with at least two 
        | approved synchronized time sources.
    * - **Calculation**
      - :code:`M2 / M1`
