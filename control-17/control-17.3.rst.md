17.3: Establish and Maintain an Enterprise Process for Reporting
Incidents =========================================================
Establish and maintain an enterprise process for the workforce to report
security incidents. The process includes reporting timeframe, personnel
to report to, mechanism for reporting, and the minimum information to be
reported. Ensure the process is publicly available to all of the
workforce. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur
that could impact this Safeguard.

  N/A          Respond             1, 2, 3

# Dependencies

-   None

# Inputs

1.  `GV51`: Enterprise Incident Response Documentation
2.  Date of last update or review of the documentation

# Operations

1.  

    Determine whether the enterprise documents process for reporting incidents by reviewing Input 1 `GV51`. Input 1 can be an incident response plan or other documentation.

    :   1.  If documentation for reporting incidents exists, M1 = 1
        2.  If documentation for reporting incidents does not exist, M1
            = 0

2.  

    Determine whether the documentation, at a minimum, outlines the following components: reporting timeframe, personnel to report to, mechanism for reporting, and the minimum information to be reported

    :   1.  For each component included, assign a value of 1. Sum the
            values. (M2)

3.  Compare Input 2 to current date and capture timeframe in months (M3)

4.  

    Determine whether the process documentation is available to the whole workforce

    :   1.  If it is available to all, M4 = 1
        2.  If it is not available to all, M4 = 0

# Measures

-   M1 = Output of Operation 1
-   M2 = Count of components included for reporting incidents process
    documentation
-   M3 = Timeframe since last update or review of documentation in
    months
-   M4 = Output of Operation 4

# Metrics

-   If M1 is 0, this safeguard receives a failing score. The other
    metrics don\'t apply.
-   If M3 is greater than twelve months, then this safeguard is measured
    at a 0 and receives a failing score. The other metrics don\'t apply.
-   If M4 is 0, this safeguard receives a failing score for this metric.
    Other metrics still apply.
