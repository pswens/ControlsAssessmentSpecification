17.2: Establish and Maintain Contact Information for Reporting Security
Incidents =========================================================
Establish and maintain contact information for parties that need to be
informed of security incidents. Contacts may include internal staff,
third-party vendors, law enforcement, cyber insurance providers,
relevant government agencies, Information Sharing and Analysis Center
(ISAC) partners, or other stakeholders. Verify contacts annually to
ensure that information is up-to-date.

  N/A          Respond             1, 2, 3

# Dependencies

-   None

# Inputs

1.  `GV51`: Enterprise Incident Response Documentation
2.  Date of last update or review of the documentation

# Operations

1.  

    Determine whether the enterprise documents establish and maintain contact information for reporting security incidents by reviewing Input 1 `GV51`. Input 1 can be an incident response plan or other documentation.

    :   1.  If documentation outlining contact information exists, M1 =
            1
        2.  If documentation outlining contact information does not
            exist, M1 = 0

2.  Compare Input 2 to current date and capture timeframe in months (M2)

# Measures

-   M1 = Output of Operation 1
-   M2 = Timeframe since last update or review of documentation in
    months

# Metrics

-   If M1 is 0, this safeguard receives a failing score. The other
    metrics don\'t apply.
-   If M2 is greater than twelve months, then this safeguard is measured
    at a 0 and receives a failing score. The other metrics don\'t apply.
