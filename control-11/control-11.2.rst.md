  Data         Recover             1, 2, 3

## Dependencies

-   Safeguard 1.1: Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset
    Inventory
-   Safeguard 2.1: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory
-   Safeguard 4.1: Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process

## Inputs

1.  `GV1`: Enterprise asset inventory
2.  `GV5`: Authorized software inventory
3.  `GV3`: Configuration standards

## Operations

1.  For each asset in `GV1` identify and enumerate assets that are
    in-scope for automated backups: `GV33` (M1)

2.  

    Use `GV5` to identify authorized backup software and for each asset identified in Operation 1

    :   1.  Identify and enumerate assets covered by at least one
            authorized backup software: `GV34` (M2)
        2.  Identify and enumerate assets not covered by at least one
            authorized backup software (M3)

3.  

    Use `GV3` to check if the software on assets identifed in Operation 2.1 is configured correctly

    :   1.  Identify and enumerate assets with properly configured
            backup software (M4)
        2.  Identify and enumerate assets with improperly configured
            backup software (M5)

4.  

    For each asset with backup software identified in Operation 2.1, examine logs to determine the most recent successful backup date. Compare that date to current date and capture timeframe in days.

    :   1.  Identify and enumerate assets that have been backeup within
            seven days or less (M6)
        2.  Identify and enumerate assets that have been backedup
            outside of a sevend day window (M7)

## Measures

-   M1 = Count of assets within scope for automated backups
-   M2 = Count of in-scope assets with authorized backup software
    installed
-   M3 = Count of in-scope assets without authorized backup software
    installed
-   M4 = Count of in-scope assets with properly configured backup
    software
-   M5 = Count of in-scope assets with improperly configured backup
    software
-   M6 = Count of in-scope assets backed up within a week
-   M7 = Count of in-scope assets not backed up within a week

## Metrics

### Coverage

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Metric**      | | The percentage of in-scoope assets with         |
|                 |   properly configured authorized                  |
|                 | | backup software                                 |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Calculation** | `M4 / M1`                                         |

### Compliance

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Metric**      | | The percentage of in-scope assets backed up     |
|                 |   within a week timeframe                         |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Calculation** | `M6 / M1`                                         |
