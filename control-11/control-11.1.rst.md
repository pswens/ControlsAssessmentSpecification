# 11.1: Establish and Maintain a Data Recovery ProcessÂ 

Establish and maintain a data recovery process. In the process, address
the scope of data recovery activities, recovery prioritization, and the
security of backup data. Review and update documentation annually, or
when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this
Safeguard.

  Asset Type   Security Function   Implementation Groups
  ------------ ------------------- -----------------------
  Data         Recover             1, 2, 3

## Dependencies

-   None

## Inputs

1.  Data recovery process for the enterprise
2.  Date of last update to the data recovery process

## Operations

1.  

    Check if enterprise has a data recovery process Input 1

    :   1.  If so, M1 = 1
        2.  If not, M1 = 0

2.  

    Examine the enterprise\'s data recovery process and determine if it addresses, at a minimum, the scope of data recovery activities, recovery prioritization, and the security of backup data

    :   1.  For each element included within the process, assing the
            element a value of 1. M2 = sum of all the values.

3.  Compare the date of last update to the data recovery process to the
    curren date and capture timeframe in months (M3)

## Measures

-   M1 = Output of Operation 1
-   M2 = Sum of elements included in the data recoery process
-   M3 = Timeframe in months of last update to the data recovery process

## Metrics

If M1 is 0, the safeguard receives a failing score. The other metrics
don\'t apply. If M3 is greater than twelve, this safeguard is measured
at a 0 and receives a failing score. The other metrics don\'t apply.
