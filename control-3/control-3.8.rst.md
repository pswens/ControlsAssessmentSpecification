# 3.8: Document Data Flows

Document data flows. Data flow documentation includes service provider
data flows and should be based on the enterpriseÂ’s data management
process. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant
enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

  Data         Identify            2, 3

## Dependencies

-   Safeguard 3.1: Establish and Maintain a Data Management Process
-   Safeguard 3.2: Establish and Maintain a Data Inventory

## Inputs

1.  Documentation outlining data flow for enterprise owned data.
    Documentation should include, at a minimum, data flows to external
    enterprises.
2.  `GV12`: Sensitive Data Inventory
3.  Date of last review of the data flow documentation

## Operations

1.  

    Check if the enterprise has data flow documentation (Input 1).

    :   1.  If Input 1 exists M = 1
        2.  Otherwise M1 = 0

2.  

    Using :code:\`GV12\`and identify data that flows to external enterprises

    :   1.  Enumerate the data that flows to external enterprises (M2)

3.  

    Compare Input 1 and the output of Operation 2

    :   1.  Enumerate data flows from Operation 2 that are included in
            Input 1 (M3)
        2.  Enumerate data flows from Operation 2 that are not included
            in Input 1 (M4)

4.  Compare the current date to that provided in Input 3. Note the
    timeframe in months (M5)

## Measures

-   M1 = Output of Operation 1
-   M2 = Count of data flows to external enterprises
-   M3 = Count of data flows included in the data flow doumentaion
-   M4 = Count of data flows not included in the data flow documentation
-   M5 = Count of months since last review of the data flow
    documentation

## Metrics

-   If M1 is 0, this safeguard receives a failing score. The other
    metrics don\'t apply.
-   If M5 is greater than twelve, this safeguard receives a failing
    score. The other metrics don\'t apply.
