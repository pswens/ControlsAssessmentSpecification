# Dependencies

-   Safeguard 5.1: Establish and Maintain an Inventory of Accounts

# Inputs

1.  `GV22`: Inventory of accounts
2.  List of users identified as administrators

Assumptions \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--#. For the purpose of this control, it is
assumed that users identified as administrators that have an active
administrative and non-administrative account have properly dedicated
accounts for administrative privileges.

# Operations

1.  

    Using `GV22` and Input 2

    :   1.  Identify and enumerate users identified as administrators
            with active administrator accounts (M1)
        2.  Identify and enumerate users identified as administrators
            without active administrator accounts (M2)
        3.  Identify and enumerate users not identified as
            administrators with active administrator accounts (M3)

2.  

    Using `GV22` and output of Operation 1.1

    :   1.  Identify and enumerate users identified as administrators
            that have an active non-administrative user account (M4)
        2.  Identify and enumerate users identified as administrators
            that do not have an active non-administrative user account
            (M5)

# Measures

-   M1 = Count of authorized administrative users with active
    administrator accounts
-   M2 = Count of authorized administrative users without active
    administrator accounts
-   M3 = Count of non-administrative users with active administrator
    accounts
-   M4 = Count of authorized administrative users with an active
    administrative and non-administrative account
-   M5 = Count of authorized administrative users without an active
    administrative and non-administrative account
-   M6 = Count of Input 2
